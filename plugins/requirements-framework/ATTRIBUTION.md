## Superpowers Plugin

Process skills (brainstorming, writing-plans, executing-plans, test-driven-development,
systematic-debugging, verification-before-completion, subagent-driven-development,
finishing-a-development-branch, using-git-worktrees, dispatching-parallel-agents,
receiving-code-review, requesting-code-review, using-requirements-framework, writing-skills)
are adapted from the [Superpowers plugin](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) by Jesse Vincent,
licensed under MIT.

Structural patterns and workflow logic are preserved; educational prose has been rewritten
for consistency with the requirements framework's voice and conventions. Supporting reference
files (`references/` subdirectories) follow the same approach: structural patterns preserved,
content adapted.
