<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
If you think there is even a 1% chance a skill might apply to what you are doing, you ABSOLUTELY MUST invoke the skill.

IF A SKILL APPLIES TO YOUR TASK, YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE. YOU MUST USE IT.

This is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.

# Using Skills

**Invoke relevant skills BEFORE any response or action.** Use the `Skill` tool — never use the Read tool on skill files.

## Skill Priority

1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) — determine HOW to approach
2. **Review/quality skills second** (pre-commit, deep-review) — ensure quality
3. **Domain skills third** (framework-specific) — guide implementation

## Skill Types

**Rigid** (TDD, debugging, verification): Follow exactly.

**Flexible** (brainstorming, writing-plans): Adapt principles to context.

## User Instructions

Instructions say WHAT, not HOW. "Add X" or "Fix Y" doesn't mean skip workflows.

**Full skill catalog, red flags, and auto-satisfy mappings:** See `references/skill-catalog.md`
