      📋 **No commit plan found for this session**

      Before making code changes, you should plan your commits.

      **Required**: Create a commit plan that describes:
      - What changes you'll make
      - How you'll split them into atomic commits
      - What order to make the changes

      **Why this matters**:
      - Ensures commits are atomic and reviewable
      - Prevents "fix comments" commits
      - Follows project conventions

      **To proceed**: Run `req satisfy commit_plan` after creating a plan
    checklist:
      - "Identified the changes needed for this feature/fix"
      - "Determined atomic commit boundaries (each commit is reviewable)"
      - "Planned commit sequence and dependencies"
      - "Considered what can be safely rolled back"
      - "Created plan file documenting the approach"
