  ## Blocked: Design Approval Required

  **Execute**: `/brainstorm`

  Explore requirements, propose approaches, and get design approval before writing code.

  **Why this matters**: Unexamined assumptions in "simple" tasks cause the most wasted work.
  Even a short design forces you to think before coding.
