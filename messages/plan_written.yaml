  ## Blocked: Implementation Plan Required

  **Execute**: `/write-plan`

  Create a bite-sized implementation plan with exact file paths, test commands, and commit points.

  **Why this matters**: Plans with 2-5 minute steps prevent scope creep and ensure
  every change is tested and committed incrementally.
