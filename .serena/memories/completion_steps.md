- After edits in repo: run `./sync.sh deploy` to update `~/.claude/hooks/`; after hotfix in deployed, run `./sync.sh pull`.
- Always check `./sync.sh status` before committing to ensure repo and deployed are in sync.
- Run tests: `python3 hooks/test_requirements.py` (and `python3 hooks/test_branch_size_calculator.py` if relevant).
- If plugin components changed, run `./update-plugin-versions.sh` to refresh `git_hash` fields.
- Run `ruff check` or `python3 hooks/ruff_check.py` before finalizing changes.
